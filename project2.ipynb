The\\n                minimum cart value is 199, sometimes sounds like a joke because\\n                Groceries seldom cost that much every day.  blinkit\n",

That is in line with the customer last\\n                or who gives two hoots about the customer attitude of big\\n                companies in India. While one has to use the app cos you don't\\n                have an option, expect their customer support to be the worse.  blinkit\n",

Only point I would ask\\n                Blinkit to consider is changing the 10 mins delivery time put as\\n                it says on the app. Would be apt to say Within 30 mins like\\n                Dominoes.  blinkit\n",

If you\\n                order any fruit or vegetable, their will be damaged pieces with\\n                the order. If the product ordered is not available with them,\\n                they will send substitutes. Example, I ordered Sun Gold Zephyr\\n                Kiwi and they delivered Green Kiwi. This is not an isolated\\n                incident. It has happened many a times in the past and I had to\\n                contact their support team. They are supposed to make one's life\\n                easy but you end up wasting time and getting frustrated.  blinkit\n",

Also, I just realised that\\n                things like banana leaf and betel leaf are also available which\\n                is also never available on other apps and hard to find even\\n                outside... I am impressed and wondering why I didn't start using\\n                it earlier. However I wish even micro greens were available,\\n                especially small methi, as it's again hard to find.  blinkit\n",

On my first few orders the\\n                delivery was free then from 10 to 20 rs delivery charge I now\\n                have to Pay 50 plus Bucks for Meer items.

Was quite satisfied\\n                with the service, but, from last few orders I have been facing\\n                issue with the items received. Even, if the the item is not\\n                available, they accept the order and send the different item.\\n                Apart from this, in my last order, I ordered 5kg rice instead\\n                they delivered 5kg sugar. They didn't even bother to refund the\\n                amount of the ordered item rather insisting me to take the\\n                differential amount.  blinkit\n",

It's under 7 day return policy. I have been\\n                told by customer support to share pictures . In pictures, you\\n                cannot judge that the product tastes bad. They declined my\\n                refund request based on the picture. Also, the product received\\n                was close to expiry date (just 15 days). I would not suggest\\n                anyone to order from blinkit. It's a lot hassel in case you\\n                receive bad quality product as they don't have fair policies.  blinkit\n",

Blinkit takes Rs12 as delivery\\n                fees even if cart value is more than 199. While if I use my\\n                another number from which I have ordered very less, Delivery\\n                fees is zero. This discriminatory behaviour and price\\n                manipulation is unacceptable. And I have decided to boycott\\n                Blinkit from now.  blinkit\n",

I was\\n                  relying on the order to be delivered on time, and this\\n                  experience has caused unnecessary inconvenience.To make\\n                  matters worse, there was no clear communication about the\\n                  cancellation or compensation. This lack of professionalism and\\n                  poor customer service is unacceptable. I expected better\\n                  reliability from such a reputed platform. JioMart seriously\\n                  needs to improve its processes🤬  jiomart\n",

My products were cheese slice, burger buns and\\n                  refine oil. There are some problems I faced. 1) They send sms\\n                  of delivery received before sending actual product. 2) My\\n                  cheese slice was also missing in the package because there was\\n                  a small hole in the sealed packaging. 3) Burger buns was also\\n                  not fresh. So, quality of burger buns was so bad. Final\\n                  conclusion: Now, I will never order again on jiomart in my\\n                  life.  jiomart\n",

Most of the times they\\n                  either don't deliver some product or they will deliver some\\n                  different product. You have to go through a very long so\\n                  called processes. Not advisable for ordering. I have already\\n                  raised multiple requests.

Customer service is also\\n                  worst as they don't have courtesy to understand from the\\n                  customers point of view. Jiomart please shutdown your service  jiomart\n",

Also I want to change my address in\\n                  milk basket but I'm not able to do so. Do milk basket deliver\\n                  in vadodara or not. Please reply.  jiomart\n",

The delivery person demanded the OTP while still at\\n                  the store, stating that if I didn't provide it immediately, he\\n                  would cancel my order. The OTP is meant to be given upon\\n                  delivery, not before. Despite my refusal, he canceled the\\n                  order. This behavior is unacceptable and feels deceptive. I\\n                  expect better service from Jiomart. Please take action to\\n                  prevent such incidents in the future and improve the customer\\n                  experience.  jiomart\n",

This\\n                  caused major inconvenience, like when I urgently needed milk\\n                  for tea for guests. If 30 minutes isn't realistic, please\\n                  update it to an accurate timeline. False promises hurt trust.\\n                  Improve with live tracking, better ETAs, and communication\\n                  with delivery agents. Fix these issues soon to retain\\n                  customers. Transparency matters more than unfulfilled\\n                  promises.  jiomart\n",

On top of all I am unable to use the\\n                  gift card which I purchased from Paytm . Instead of solving my\\n                  problem , the customer service is going round and round\\n                  wasting the time . I would have given zero rating if there was\\n                  an option .  jiomart\n",

On Aug17th,morning\\n                  someone contacted and asked for an OTP, stating the order\\n                  would be delivered in the evening. I refused to provide the\\n                  OTP, and the caller canceled the order. When I contacted\\n                  customer support, they simply advised me to reorder.

So if you can't deliver just don't irritate me by\\n                  sending notifications to order.    zepto\n",

      "3325       2    7 December 2024      Its been great using this app. But Free delivery on cart\\n                  Rs.199 can be auto applied instead of customer everytime\\n                  selecting option.

What a waste of a\\n                  app, trying to compete with blinkit and such apps with such a\\n                  strategy.    zepto\n",

Each time I\\n                  contact customer support, they repeat the same message—that\\n                  the refund will be processed in a few business days. This\\n                  delay and lack of clear communication is really frustrating. I\\n                  hope Zepto improves    zepto\n",
