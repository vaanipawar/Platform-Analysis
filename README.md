# Platform-Analysis
 This project dives into reviews and ratings from Zepto, Blinkit, and JioMart to uncover trends in user engagement. We explore which platform has the most reviews, when people leave the most feedback, how reviews and ratings are connected, and the average rating each platform receives.
